# Payment API (Prototype)

### Lumen Framework

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Installation and Configuration

The project can be setup in the same way in Laravel project. The below step provided is for setting up the project using Docker

### Docker

You should have docker installed on your computer already.

#### Run setup script

```shell
./setup.sh
```

Wait until everything up and running before moving on to the next step, database may take longer to configure at the first time

#### Setting up database

```shell
docker exec -it payment-api_app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
###### Note

- Default URL: http://localhost:8000
- If experiencing error when running the solution in docker, it may down to directory permission settings. Check permission for `/logs` and `/docker/storage` folder in particular.
- The project only tested on the least copy of openSUSE Tumbleweed and should also work on other OS.
